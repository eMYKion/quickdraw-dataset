# The Quick, Draw! Dataset Fork

Work done by Akshay Dharmavaram and Mayank Mali in partial fullfillment of 16-824: Visual Learning and Recognition while at CMU.

This repository is a component of [TroGAN: Disguising Contours to Look Like Sketches](https://github.com/Aks-Dmv/TroGAN). It contains the modified code to download and render (to image files) the quickdraw user-sketches.

Please note that this repository is forked and modified from the [The Quick, Draw! Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) project.
